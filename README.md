## How the program works

SunDowner is a JavaFX project that calculates and graphically displays sun and moon positions and phases.</br>
It uses almost all the features of [commons-suncalc](https://shredzone.org/maven/commons-suncalc/index.html)
which is also available on GitHub and Maven.

SunDowner includes the following features (separated as tabs in the program):

- Daily information
- calendar
- Moon phases
- Moon parameters
- solar parameters
- Sun and moon times
- Big Data
- Sunrise and sunset
- Altitude and local time
- Altitude and azimuth
- Earth-moon distance
- Earth-Sun distance
- Sun position diagram (Cartesian)
- Sun position diagram (polar)

## A notice

Since the calculated data depends on the geographic data, there should be an internet connection</br>
to be able to set the location using the maps from OpenStreetMap.</br>
To set the location with OSM, just right-click on the map.

## Technology used

This JavaFX project was built with the Apache NetBeans 25 IDE [NetBeans 25](https://netbeans.apache.org/).
